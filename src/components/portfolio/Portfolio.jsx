// I'm a Front-End Web Developer with a passion for creating
//             responsive, user-friendly websites. I recently completed Georgia
//             Tech's Full-Stack Web Developer Coding Bootcamp and look forward to
//             implementing the knowledge I've gained. I'm an adaptable,
//             enthusiastic problem solver that enjoys team-building and
//             collaboration. I've been apart of the sales and hospitality world
//             for the last decade and have decided to push forward with my passion
//             for creating.
//             <br />
//             <br />
//             I'm also a huge outdoorsman, photographer, environmentalist and
//             humanitarian. If I'm not nestled in front of my computer, then you
//             can be certain that I'm somewhere in the mountains.
