     <p>To truly understand me, one must realize that the outdoors is the one thing in this world that seems to keep
        me aligned. Wether it be hanging out in a hammock, skydiving, river rafting, kayaking, snowboarding,
        downhill mountain biking, backpacking, etc. All I know is that if it makes me slightly nervous and gets me
        outdoors, then I'm all in.</p>
    
    <p>I grew up in Columbus, Ga, which is only a few hours drive west of my current location in Savannah, Ga. I've
        recently moved back to the south, but only to hike The Appalachian Trail! I was living in Denver, CO, when the
        idea to hike The Appalachain Trail, once again, passed through my mind. I decided to head back to the south and create
        a better plan. This plan was no more when I returned from a snowboaridng trip in March and the pandemic was in
        full swing. I can only describe it as a crippling realization, but I quickly understood that not being able to
        hike The Appalachian Trail would be the least of my worries.</p>
        
    <p>I'm in the process of acquiring my Full-Stack Web Developer certificate at Georgia Tech. As a Full-Stack Web
        Developer, I enjoy creating responsive, user-friendly websites. I truly love creating and web development has
        given me the opportunity to do just that.</p>
